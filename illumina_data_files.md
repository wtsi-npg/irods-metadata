# Data files generated for the Illumina sequencing platform

This document describes the data files generated for the Illumina sequencing platform.
It includes details of files created by current and previous generations of instrument
and analysis pipelines, including file types that are no longer created. Current file
types are indicated in the table below.

## File naming

The files are named using a convention so that related files share a name prefix. In
the table below where a file is described as being related to a "corresponding" file,
they share the same prefix. E.g. `[prefix].cram` and `[prefix].cram.crai`).
